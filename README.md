Solar System Simulator
===========
Experimenting with jME3 / Summer 2011

- High resolution imagary courtasy of NASA and others. 
- Planetary distances are proportional to each other.
- Planetary sizes are proportional to each other. The Sun had to be scaled down further due it being insanely massive.
- Planetary axial tilt is roughly accurate.
- Planetary oribits are roughly accurate to the date. The date can be increased/decreased via the ```f``` and ```r``` keys.
- Planetary rotation scaled to one Earth day per 30s.
- Atmosphere and night-lights are implemented for Earth.

Main class:
